# Summary

Players race to offset our human impact on the planet. In Act One, players race to rewild our forests by buying and selling fungible tree tokens using stablecoins on a mobile app. All proceeds of the sales go towards real world tree planting and rewilding efforts. 

Description
--------
Humanity has had a detrimental impact on the world. Our ecosystem - environment and communities - need help. A recovery will require contributions from all of us. The key is to get everyone engaged in contributing to the effort to save our planet. Our solution can be used to address all types of challenges within our ecosystem, and in act one, we have chosen to focus on rewilding forests.

Every year about 18 million hectares of forest is cleared. Forests play crucial roles in moderating the global climate - if deforestation continues, climate change will accelerate and more natural disasters will ensue. There is an urgent need to rewild forests across the globe to restore our land and fight climate change. And, we need to heal and reconcile with communities that have been impacted by deforestation either through commerce or colonization.  

However, despite the importance of rewilding our planet, many people are disconnected from where this work happens - they don’t see, experience, and benefit from it directly.  There are so many local, not for profit groups around the world working hard to rewild forests in their regions. They need our help securing capital to purchase non-productive land and grow sustainable forests. 

Our objective in creating this solution was to engage, educate and motivate people to join the effort to rewild our planet. We wanted to create a direct connection between people and the planting of trees - even if it’s happening in a forest far away, and help local and global organizations raise funds to plant trees. 

Through the use of smart contracts, we’ve created a game centered around buying and selling fungible tree tokens, with 100% of the sales funneling back to real life forest rewilding. The race to rewild involves buying and selling seeds to mature them into full grown trees. The seeds are fungible tokens representing the lifecycle of a tree: from seed, to sprout, to sapling, to tree. Each time you sell a token it will grow to the next phase of its cycle. Once the token has been sold across four players, it becomes a tree and is ready to be planted in the virtual forest. Planting a tree unlocks perks such as Human Impact Offsets to access special discounts at local stores, a new seed to start the cycle over again, and the option to purchase an NFT generated as a result of the tree planting.

Here’s how it works. First, people buy a forest fungible token for 5 stablecoins. They can choose to buy a seed from the seed bank, a seed from another player (which will become a sprout once purchased), a sprout (which becomes a sapling upon purchase), or a sapling (which becomes a tree upon purchase). Second, people invite friends to join the race to rewild the planet. Friends can buy forest fungible tokens to help grow a tree. Third, participants can follow the growth progress of their fungible token in real-time on the app - as the fungible token gets passed between players, everyone involved can watch it grow on the blockchain. Each time someone sells a fungible token, they collect a Human Impact Offset. These offsets can be used to unlock perks and discounts from local businesses that support rewilding efforts in the community. 

Once the fungible tree token has been passed between four players, the tree will be full grown and is ready to plant anywhere around the world. The person with the fully grown fungible tree token can select a location to plant their tree easily through the app. The tree is geo-located and everyone who participated in growing the tree can see how the tree grows in real-life. 

When a tree is planted, everyone wins! The planted tree generates five new fungible seed tokens which are distributed to each person involved in the planting of that tree. In addition, the planted tree unlocks an original NFT that’s been geo-stamped with the real world location of the tree. Players have the option to claim the NFT at a base price of 50 cUSD.

Compared to existing carbon offset programs that do not account for challenges such as forest fires (which can be good) or the impact on society and communities, our solution gives our ecosystems a chance to take on a natural and full lifecycle. If a tree that is planted in rewilding burns down, we can celebrate the lifecycle of the forest, rather than lamenting an artificial loss. Also, the human impact offset recognizes the contribution that people make to offset their environmental impact - helping to connect people directly to tree planting efforts in forests far away.

Our solution is aimed at individuals and corporations. Phase one involves engaging individuals to join together to rewild forests. Phase two engages corporations to use the platform for fundraising and event initiatives that support their ESG target. The rewild concept can be applied to many different types of causes that support sustainable development goals beyond forest rewilding, including restoring habitats, wildlife, and ocean life.

Overall, we believe our solution offers an engaging and innovative way to create a direct connection between people and trees through the investment of time and money, and we do so in a transparent way - thanks to blockchain technology. By engaging all communities - those in cities and those close to the forests, we will collectively repair the damage done to our ecosystems and the communities who have suffered.
